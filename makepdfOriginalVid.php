The closer the alignment between your role at work with your CMV profile, the greater the opportunity for you and your organisation to build a long-term partnership. The more distant the work you do every day is from your core motivational values, the more dissatisfaction you are likely to experience in your work life. Your CMV survey results are summarised in the chart below, which highlights a Motivational Value Index score across each of the nine perspectives based on your answers from the survey. Results with higher scores along the Motivational Value Index represent core values that are most cherished by you.
